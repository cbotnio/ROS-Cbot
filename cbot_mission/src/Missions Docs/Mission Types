Here we define the types of different missions available and their parameters.
Each motion primitive can be named which makes it reusable without redefining. 
Each motion primitive has it's own predefined parameters.

1) Waypoint primitive: 
This is used for specifying a single spatial point for the vehicle to move to.

Parameters:
	point: point in 3d space 
	speed: constant speed for the mission <default max speed>
	heading: constant heading angle <optional>
	captureRadius:	Radius to consider the waypoint as reached
	slipRadius:  Radius(bigger than capture radius) to cosider mission completed without 
	pause: To specify if the vehicle has to be paused after completing this mission.
	timeout:  Time in which the mission has to be completed

2) Line Following primitive: 
This is used for specifying a single spatial point for the vehicle to move to.

Parameters:
	point: point in 3d space 
	speed: constant speed for the mission <default max speed>
	heading: constant heading angle <optional>
	captureRadius:	Radius to consider the waypoint as reached	
	slipRadius:  Radius(bigger than capture radius) to cosider mission completed without 
	pause: To specify if the vehicle has to be paused after completing this mission.
	timeout:  Time in which the mission has to be completed
