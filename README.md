# Cbot
The C-Bot is an unmanned underwater vehicle developed by the Marine Instrumentation Department, CSIR-National Institute of Oceaography, Dona Paula, Goa.

# ROS-CBOT
This repository contains the software to be used on CBOT. It contains the algorithms for control, guidance and mission planning.

## Pre-requisites
This assumes that you have ROS-Kinetic or ROS-Melodic installed on your machine. 

You should have the following packages installed:
1. UUV-Simulator (provide link)
2. CBOT-Gazebo (provide link)
3. ros_rtsp (provide link)
4. CBOT-GCS (provide link)

## Installation instructions
- Create a workspace:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin init  # initialize your catkin workspace
```
The src should also contain the previously mentioned packages.

- Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MohitGupta007/ROS-Cbot.git
```

- Create a ports.sh file to open the virtual serial ports(required for software in the loop simulation when not using real hardware).
```
socat PTY,link=/tmp/gps-write,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/tmp/gps-read,raw,echo=0&
echo "GPS port ready: gps-write, gps-read"
sleep 0.1

socat PTY,link=/tmp/ahrs-write,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/tmp/ahrs-read,raw,echo=0&
echo "AHRS port ready: ahrs-write, ahrs-read"
sleep 0.1

socat PTY,link=/tmp/thr-write,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/tmp/thr-read,raw,echo=0&
echo "Thruster port ready: thr-write, thr-read"
sleep 0.1

echo "GUI port ready: GUI-write, GUI-read"
socat PTY,link=/tmp/GUI-write,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/tmp/GUI-read,raw,echo=0
```

## Running the package
- Run the ports.sh file by running:
```
$ bash ports.sh 
```

- Run the CBOT-Gazebo package to launch the UUV in Gazebo environment. See the repo for more information.
```
$ roslaunch cbot_description upload_cbot.launch 
```

- Run this repositiory
```
$ roslaunch cbot cbot.launch
```
